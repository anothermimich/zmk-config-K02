This keymap was made to be used with [K02](https://github.com/anothermimich/K02/) keyboard. It will work with the [Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) too. It has support to [zmk studio](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/studio) and [keymap editor](https://github.com/nickcoutsos/keymap-editor?tab=readme-ov-file).

I've taken inspiration from [Robert U](https://github.com/urob) [homerow mods](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config#timeless-homerow-mods) and [Miryoku ZMK](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_zmk) keymap made by [Manna Harbour](https://github.com/manna-harbour).
